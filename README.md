# VIO_MultiState_ConstraintKalmanFilter
Real-time vision-aided inertial navigation pipeline using a Multi-state constraint kalman Filter for localization.

MSCKF (Multi-State Constraint Kalman Filter) is an EKF based **tightly-coupled** visual-inertial odometry algorithm. [S-MSCKF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00036) is MSCKF's stereo version. This project is a Python reimplemention of S-MSCKF, the code is directly translated from official C++ implementation [KumarRobotics/msckf_vio](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/msckf_vio).
